The content is based around the traditional Sancaijian (三才劍), the Three Realms Sword form, which allows you to practice alone, and with others, and with techniques from Yang Wudang Taijijian. Jianfa is a martial art where the user&rsquo;s skill with the weapon is much more important than the raw strength, size, or gender of the practitioner, allowing everyone to compete fairly against one another in sparring and tournaments.</p>\n<p>Registration is for 10 weeks of instruction in traditional Chinese swordplay (jianfa) which will cover:<br />&ndash; Complete instruction in the Sancaijian (Three Realms Sword) taolu (form)<br />&ndash; Detailed instruction in all 13 basic cuts of traditional Wudang sword based Chinese sword arts<br />&ndash; Two person drills, including Sword Triangles<br />&ndash; Overview of the Sancaijian two person taolu (form)<br />&ndash; Full application for each move in the taolu (form)<br />&ndash; All techniques and drills are preparation for sparring practice.

Having trained in Wudang Dan Pai Jian, Yang Wudang Taijijian, Sancaijian, Yang Michuan Taijijian. As a life-long student, he continues his training with the current 13th Generation inheritors of Wudang Dan Pai, Dr. Lu and Master Chang. His Yang Wudang Taijijian was taught to him by Master William Ho, and he has also trained with Scott Rodell. He also placed 2nd at the Seattle International Martial Arts Championship in the Sword Sparring (sanjian) tournament. Aidan is a firm believer in applying swordsmanship in full contact sparring to fully understand the art, with a holistic approach to training methodologies, utilising forms/taolu, drills, constraint-led approach games, and free sparring to enable his students to reach their full potential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About Sancaijian:</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sancaijian (三才劍 &#8211; the Three Realms Sword), is a taolu (Mandarin for form, equivalent to the Japanese kata) that is made up of two matching halves, that was created by Li Jinglin, the 10th generation Wudang Dan Pai grandmaster, in the late 1920s to teach the core principles of Chinese Sword Arts at the Central Guoshu Institute (CGI).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sancaijian is made up of movements from the Wudang Two-Person Taolu (more commonly called Duijian) and Wudang solo taolu, it utilises the principles of Wudang Sword Arts. It was designed to be a solo taolu that would neatly match the two halves together to create a two person taolu to practice each movement with its direct application. Due to its matching design and being taught at the CGI, it has since been included in a number of Chinese Martial Arts that were also taught at the CGI, including Sun-style Taiji, some Lineages of Xingyi, and Changquan/Longfist. </span></p>\n"

Zhang, Song-Xi (张松溪) who was both a martial artist and Daoist priest at Wudang mountain, founded Wudang Dan Pai (武当丹派).</p>\n<p>Wudang Sword uses delicate techniques along with lightning fast movements. Wudang sword goes from slow to fast and soft to hard in an instant. Attacks can be straight-line or circular. Low postures are utilized along with high jumps in the air. It is this combination that makes Wudang Sword one of the most famous and sought after sword arts in China&rsquo;s history.</p>\n<p>The traditional Wudang Sword system was passed down to Master Chang, Wu Na and Dr. Lu, Mei-hui by Grandmaster Ma, Jie (马杰) who was the 12th generation Gatekeeper of Wudang Dan Pai. The system consists of one sword form (132 movements in 6 sections), a two-person fighting form, sword and Daoist fly-whisk combined form, &ldquo;flying sword&rdquo; techniques (throwing knives), and sword sparring, among others. This system has been recognized as the most authentic Wudang Sword system by Wudang Mountain. Its techniques are direct and powerful.</p>\n<p><em>Workshop Details</em></p>\n<p>This event is a two-day martial arts and self defence seminar teaching the details of the Jian (straight sword), in the Wudang Dan Pai tradition, more commonly called Wudang Sword in English. The content will include traditional forms and techniques, application of the movements in martial arts competition and self-defence, and self development.

We recommend printing on materials with over 50% natural fibres! We&rsquo;ve collated your favourite designs from our competition, and we&rsquo;re so excited for you to use them in person!</p>\n<p>Thank you to all artists for submitting! The artists of the screenprints have free entry.</p>\n"
